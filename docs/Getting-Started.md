# Getting started

**cifuzz** commands will interactively guide you through the needed
options and show next steps. You can find a complete list of the available
commands with all supported options and parameters by calling `cifuzz command
--help` or read about them in the
[wiki](https://github.com/adombeck/cifuzz/wiki/cifuzz).

1. To initialize your project with cifuzz just execute `cifuzz init` in the
   root directory of your project. This will create a file named `cifuzz.yaml`
   containing the needed configuration and print out any necessary steps to
   set up your project.

2. The next step is to create a fuzz test. Execute `cifuzz create` and follow
   the instructions given by the command. This will create a stub for your fuzz
   test, for example `my_fuzz_test_1.cpp` and tell you how to integrate it into
   your project. You will find more detailed information in our
   [Tutorial](How-To-Write-A-Fuzz-Test.md).

3. Edit the fuzz test stub so it actually calls the function you want to test
   with the input generated by the fuzzer. To learn more about writing fuzz
   tests you can take a look at our [Tutorial](How-To-Write-A-Fuzz-Test.md) or
   one of the [example projects](../examples).

4. Start fuzzing by executing `cifuzz run my_fuzz_test_1`. **cifuzz** now builds
   the fuzz test and starts a fuzzing run.

#### Java/Kotlin:

For Java/Kotlin projects, users need to specify the fuzz target identifier in
reverse domain name notation, e.g., `com.example.FuzzTestCase`. For this
example, it means that the package name is `com.example` and the class name is
`FuzzTestCase`.

Example: `cifuzz run com.example.FuzzTestCase`.

By default, cifuzz will try to find a single fuzz test for a given JVM class.
If you want to have multiple fuzz tests in a single JVM class, use the `::`
notation to specify the named fuzz test.

Example: `cifuzz run com.example.FuzzTestCase::myNamedFuzzTest`

This will look for the class name `FuzzTestCase` in the package `com.example`
and run the `myNamedFuzzTest` method. We provide tab completion for named fuzz
test methods if cifuzz finds more than one fuzz test in the JVM class.

#### Javascript/Typescript:

For Javascript/Typescript projects, users need to specify a fuzz target
identifier consisting of a regex path pattern that is matched against
all test paths. The first test, that is matched by that pattern, gets
executed.

As an example, consider the case of two fuzz tests:

- project-root/tests/FuzzTestCase1.fuzz.js
- project-root/tests/FuzzTestCase2.fuzz.js

`cifuzz run FuzzTestCase` executes the first fuzz test, whose path
contains `FuzzTestCase`. The evaluation order is determined by
the jest test runner. `FuzzTestCase2` can be
executed explicitely by running `cifuzz run FuzzTestCase2`.

By default, the first fuzz test in that file will by executed.
If a test file contains multiple fuzz tests, one specific
fuzz test can be selected by specifying a regex test name pattern.
The regex is matched against the full name, which is a combination
of the test name and all its surrounding describe blocks.

Example: `cifuzz run FuzzTestCase1:"My fuzz test"`

The first fuzz test in FuzzTestCase1.fuzz.js matching "My fuzz test"
will be executed.

## Generate coverage report

Once you executed a fuzz test, you can generate a coverage report which shows
the line coverage of the fuzzed code:

    cifuzz coverage my_fuzz_test_1

See [coverage IDE integrations](Coverage-ide-integrations.md) for instructions
on how to generate and visualize coverage reports right from your IDE.

## Regression testing

If you are interested in running your fuzz tests as regression tests to maintain
a fast and responsive development cycle, you can check out our
[regression testing](Regression-Testing.md) guide.

## Sandboxing

On Linux, **cifuzz** runs fuzz tests in a sandbox by default to prevent them
from accidentally harming the system, for example by deleting files or killing
processes. [Minijail](https://google.github.io/minijail/minijail0.1.html) is
used for this purpose.

If you experience problems when running fuzz tests via **cifuzz** and you don't
expect your fuzz tests to do any harm to the system (or you're already running
**cifuzz** in a container), you might want to disable the sandbox via the
`--use-sandbox=false` flag or the [`use-sandbox: false` config file
setting](docs/Configuration.md#use-sandbox).

If your fuzz test needs to access some files or directories which are not
accessible in the sandbox, you can add bindings for those via the
`CIFUZZ_MINIJAIL_BINDINGS` environment variable. The bindings must be separated
by colon and be specified in the same format that is supported by the
`--bind-mount` flag of [`minijail0`](https://google.github.io/minijail/minijail0.1.html):

`CIFUZZ_MINIJAIL_BINDINGS=<src>[,[dest][,<writeable>]]`, where `<src>` must be an absolute path
and `<writeable>` is either `0` or `1`. For example:

```
CIFUZZ_MINIJAIL_BINDINGS=/tmp/foo,/tmp/foo,1:/home/user/foo,/home/user/foo,1
```
